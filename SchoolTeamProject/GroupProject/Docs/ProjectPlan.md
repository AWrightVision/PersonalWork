## 1. Introduction

A bowling alley management system that runs on the Android platform.


## 2. Process Description

#####  *Project Planning and Scoping*

Develop the documentation that will be necessary for the project:
  * A use-case model needs to be constructed to give to show interactions with the clients and the client's customers
  * A supplementary requirement document needs to be developed to show the requirements that are not represented in the use-case model
  * A design document that will provide a description of the design consideration and diagrams on the architectural and low-level designs will be developed
  * A test plan needs to be created to define the process of testing the GoBowl system's functionality, test cases need to be provided but the results do not need to be included yet
  * Project plan description will be constructed to show the activates that create the process of the software development for GoBowl

Entrance criteria
  * UML design and class diagram

Exit criteria:
  * Project plan (ProjectPlan.md)
  * Use-case model (UseCaseModel.md)
  * Supplementary requirements (ExtraRequirements.md)
  * Design document (DesignDocument.md)
  * Test plan (TestPlan.md)
  * Confirm with client (Harry and Sally) about all documentation and system designs


##### *User Interface Design and Development*
The user interface for the manager and the customer will need to be properly constructed. The UI should adhere to the UI representations given in the DesignDocumentation. Once functionalities of the system are complete, UI should be integrated into the system with full functionality.

Entrance criteria
  * Completion of initial documentation stage.

Exit criteria
  * The UI for both manager and customer users are constructed
  * Client is satisfied with the appearance of the UI


##### *Class Implementation and Development*
Implementation of the Android application (java code). Developers should adhere to the requirements of the GoBowl system and the UML diagram for implementation. Developers should reference the use case documentation. External libraries need to be fully integrated within system when they are accessible.  

Entrance criteria:
  * UML designs, Use Case documentation

Exit criteria:
  * Working version of Android application
  * 100% code coverage on tests needs to be completed


##### *User Manual Development*
Construction of a user manual.

Entrance criteria:
  * UI and class implementation needs to be complete or near completion.

Exit criteria
  * Completion of user manual.


##### *Testing*
Testing will adhere to the TestPlan documentation. Tester will construct test cases to be tested against the system. This will assure that the system is properly functional.

Entrance criteria:
  * TestPlan documentation
  * Working application

Exit criteria:
  * 100% coverage on the tests
